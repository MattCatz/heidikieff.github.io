# Howdy!

I’m currently a senior at Auburn University, studying Graphic Design. Originally from Buffalo, NY to Montgomery, AL and now in Auburn, AL has allowed me to appreciate different cultures that has influenced me in my art and design. Design allows me to stick my nose in fields I’m not familiar with, which helps me grow in other aspects of my life. I believe design is about human connection and I enjoy getting to know people beyond the surface. I wake up every morning excited to create something. I truly enjoy the process and research of each project I get to work on. Whether that be slow or fast  paced, I love every second of it. Ideally I'd liked to live out west and be a cowgirl for the rest of my life, but design seems to be the next best thing.
