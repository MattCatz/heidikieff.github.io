# Howdy!

I’m currently a senior at Auburn University, studying Graphic Design. I'm originally from Buffalo, Ny, but my family moved to Prattville, Al when I was in highschool. Since living in these different spectrums of the country, it has made me appreciate the different cultures that come with them. This has been a large influence in my work. Design allows me to stick my nose in fields I’m not familiar with, which helps me grow in other aspects of my life. I believe design is about human connection and I enjoy getting to know people beyond the surface. I wake up every morning excited to create something. I truly enjoy the process and research of each project I get to work on. Whether that be slow or fast  paced, I love every second of it. Ideally I'd liked to live out west and be a cowgirl for the rest of my life, but design seems to be the next best thing.
