description: |
  Modula was the first high resolution font family designed on the new Apple
  Macintosh 512K. The font embraces it's digital design process. It was designed
  to complement the computers ability to produce perfect geometric elements
  unlike existing analog fonts, who produced hideous emulations of the original
  because of the limitations of bitmap fonts. I wanted my House of Cards to tell
  that story. Showing each letterform and pairing it with a composition that
  represented that new age of technology.
