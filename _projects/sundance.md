  This trailer was a final project created in a Kinetic Typography course at Auburn Universityâ€™s School of Industrial + Graphic Design. The objective was to create a print piece and video promotion that are connected using an augmented reality app. The design concept is a rebrand for the Sundance Film Festival. It incorporates a collection of type, images and shapes that move individually but flow as one concept throughout the piece. The video is designed to capture the viewers attention and incite excitement about the festival. This conceptual design is intended to be professional promotion that could actually be used by the Sundance Film Festival in the year 2020.
